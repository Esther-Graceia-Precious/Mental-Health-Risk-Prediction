# Mental Health Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
This project aims to predict whether an individual is at risk of mental health issues based on workplace and personal factors.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Mental Health Survey
- Contains employee survey data
- Target variable: treatment (Yes/No)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Encoding
3. Feature Scaling
4. Model Training
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
6. Evaluation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost
- Voting Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
- Best Model: XGBoost
- Accuracy: ~73%
- Balanced Precision & Recall
- Low Overfitting

## Key Insights
- Work interference and lack of support increase mental health risk
- Early prediction helps organizations take preventive measures

## Future Improvements
- Add SHAP for explainability
- Deploy using Streamlit
- Improve feature engineering
